# 🚆 Railway Reservation System – Relational Database Project

An end-to-end **relational database system** simulating the operations of a **railway reservation portal**, built using **SQL (SQLite)**. This project was developed as part of **CSE 3330: Database Systems and File Structures.** at **The University of Texas at Arlington** (Fall 2024).

The goal of this project is to apply core relational database principles to design, create, and manage a system that emulates how modern railway booking systems operate behind the scenes. It provides robust functionality for tracking **passenger bookings**, **train statuses**, **travel schedules**, and **ticket types**, all while supporting complex data queries to extract insights for decision-making.

Key project components include:

- 🛠️ **Schema Design**: Based on an Entity-Relationship (ER) model, we implemented normalized tables to capture passenger info, ticket types, train records, statuses, and reservations.
- 📥 **Data Loading**: Bulk data loading was performed using SQL `INSERT INTO` statements sourced from CSV files.
- 🔍 **SQL Queries**: A comprehensive set of SELECT statements answers real-world questions such as “Which passengers have upcoming bookings?”, “Which trains are delayed?”, and “How many people booked sleeper class?”.
- 🧾 **Reporting & Results**: Query results were reviewed to validate the system's effectiveness, and final reports were submitted to reflect system behavior and database accuracy.

> 🎯 **Project Objective**  
> To demonstrate strong understanding of **database schema design**, **relational modeling**, and **query execution** by building a fully functional mini-RDBMS mimicking a real-world railway ticketing environment.
